## Teaching & Supervision

I design practice‑oriented learning experiences that connect core concepts to real organisational contexts. I emphasise fundamentals (data modelling, security, analytics), authentic assessment, and reproducible workflows.

### Courses taught and developed
- Introduction to Data and Database Management — schema design, SQL, security
- Introduction to Web Technologies — HTML/CSS/JS foundations and web security
- Applied Cybersecurity — governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) fundamentals
- Data Analytics — regression, classification, evaluation, and visualisation

### Supervision and mentorship
- Supervised MSc students; provided structured guidance on research design, methods, and writing
- One‑to‑one mentorship on project scoping, literature mapping, and data workflows

### Teaching effectiveness
- Consistently excellent student evaluations (approx. 4.6–4.9/5 across 7 semesters)
- Positive feedback on clarity, relevance, and supportive engagement
