## RESEARCH EXPERTISE

### Applied Cybersecurity

My research addresses organizational security and risk management with particular focus on healthcare information system security, predictive modeling of cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and security governance frameworks for business organizations. This work examines risk assessment methodologies and organizational security culture, contributing to understanding of how organizations can effectively manage security challenges in digital environments.

**Key Publications:** Healthcare data breaches in integrated EHR systems (*Journal of Cybersecurity and Privacy*, 2025, Q1) | Predicting data breach occurrence using machine learning (*IJIM Data Insights*, 2022, Q1) | Organizational cybersecurity success factors (*Advances in Security, Networks, and IoT*, 2021)

### Database Systems & Security

My expertise in database management encompasses database design, normalization, and entity-relationship modeling, SQL programming and query optimization, database security mechanisms and access control, data organization and retrieval systems, and privacy-preserving database design with GDPR compliance considerations. Through teaching database management courses and research on data breaches, I have developed comprehensive understanding of database vulnerabilities, secure database architectures for sensitive organizational data, database usability and information architecture, and data quality and governance challenges in organizational contexts.

### Applied Analytics & Business Intelligence

My analytical expertise spans the complete analytics pipeline from data collection through interpretation and visualization. I am proficient in predictive modeling and machine learning (classification, regression, ensemble methods), large-scale data analysis with advanced statistical modeling (including analysis of 28,000+ organizational records), computational text analysis (topic modeling, sentiment analysis, natural language processing), and data visualization and dashboard design for organizational decision-making. This work includes extensive survey research and quantitative analysis applied to business and organizational contexts.
