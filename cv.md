## Personal details

## Personal statement


I am an information science researcher with deep expertise in applying digital technologies and data analytics to business management challenges, particularly in Healthcare Technology Management and Organisational Studies. My research bridges disciplinary boundaries to explore how AI, algorithmic systems, and workplace technologies are reshaping contemporary healthcare and business management practices.

My work employs both qualitative and quantitative methods to examine phenomena like algorithmic management, employee monitoring, and digital transformation in organisations, offering insights into their ethical, psychological, and strategic implications for healthcare operations and business performance. Through this lens, I contribute to understanding how technology mediates workplace experiences in healthcare settings and how organisations can implement digital tools that support equity, autonomy, and operational efficiency.

With extensive higher education teaching experience across multiple technical and business-related courses for seven semesters at the undergraduate level, consistently excellent student evaluations, and supervisory experience guiding postgraduate research projects, I am well-prepared to contribute effectively to undergraduate teaching, student support, and programme development in business and health education.
